What is a chatting application? Chatting applications are programmed to allow you to send messages to your friends, who are registered with that application. It allows a user to transfer text and data like picture, video, mp3, to another user. However, it typically has some limitations on various parameters such as the size of the attachment. However, you can change those parameters for your server and as per business needs. 
In a chatting application, a user can register herself/himself. After registration, they can login with their existing user id and password.
